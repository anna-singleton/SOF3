In a _regular tree_ the value in a leaf is the length of the path from
the root to the leaf.  Hence we define:

-}

emptyTreeP :: TreeP a
emptyTreeP = Leaf 0

{-

In an _ordered_ tree, all the values in the left-hand subtree are
strictly smaller than the value at the root, all the values in the
right-hand subtree are strictly greater than the value at the root,
and both subtrees are ordered.


Write a function `itp` to insert a value into a regular, ordered
tree.

Your solution should satisfy:
