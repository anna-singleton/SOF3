### 2v [10 marks]
We can get the effect of randomising, or _shuffling_, of a list, by
repeatedly taking an element of a list and inserting it into a second,
initially empty, list at a random position.  To obtain the stream of
random numbers, a _seed_, or starting point, and a _next-number_
function are parameters of the function. Implement the `shuffle`
function.

Your solution should satisfy:

shuffleTest :: Bool
shuffleTest =    shuffle psrn 1234567890 [0 .. 9] == [9,4,1,0,3,7,6,5,8,2]
              && shuffle psrn 2468013579 [0 .. 9] == [2,4,1,3,5,8,9,6,0,7]
              && shuffle id            0 [0 .. 9] == [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
              && shuffle (+1)          0 [0 .. 9] == [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
